- 👋 Hi, I’m @Undefinido, graduated in a B.S in Computer Science in 2020 in Universidad de las Islas Baleares, Spain.
- 👀 I’m interested in the game dev industry. In my repositories there are available some of my projects that I developed while I was learning Unity.
- 🌱 I’m currently getting experience at making videogames and learning all as I can, mainly in the programming side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to get the opportunity to work in the game dev industry wherever I can to keep up my apprenticeship. My idea is to work out of Spain, mainly in London.
